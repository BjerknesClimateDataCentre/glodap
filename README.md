# glodap
Tools for data management and quality control of data in the GLODAP data framework.

To set up and test, preferably use a virtual environment for python to avoid installing libraries globally. Example:

Install python 3 executables
Install virtualenv
Set up a virtual environment in the project folder:

    virtualenv -p /path/to/python3/executable venv # sets up a virtual environment in venv-folder
    source venv/bin/activate # activate the virtual environment
    pip install -r setup/requirements.txt # Install required libraries
